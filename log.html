    Finally! My DeepComputing DC-ROMA for Framework Laptop 13 arrived!
    Unfortunately that's where the joy ends, as just getting this thing to speak to me was incredibly difficult.
    It didn't help that I was traveling to London for DConf and didn't purchase a UK outlet plug so my laptop died 4 days into the trip.

    I came against quite a few problems just getting the RISC-V board to say hello to me.
    This is probably best expressed as a Q&A section.

    Q. Which dip-switch choice allows you to boot using UART?
    A. OFF/OFF = UART; ON/OFF = SD; OFF/ON = eMMC; ON/ON = SPI

    Q. Which USB-C port on the Framework Laptop motherboard supports UART?
    A. The front right supports UART; the front left supports ST-LINK.

    Q. Which USB-C pins are used for UART?
    A. SBU1 for transmit, SBU2 for receive.

    Q. Do I need a special USB-C cable?
    A. Yes. I used a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 cable because my dinky Apple charger didn't have SBU1/2 connected.

    Q. Should I order the DeepComputing Debug Expansion Card?
    A. Probably. My janky setup in London was USB-C to breakout board to UART controller to USB-A to USB-C.

    Q. What protocol does the UART receiver expect?
    A. XMODEM-1K. If it spams the letter 'C' at you then it's listening.

    Q. What serial settings are used?
    A. 3.3V TX/RX, 115200 baud, 8N1

    Q. What file format does the UART receiver expect?
    A. StarFive Secondary Program Loader (SPL). It's a simple header attached to your RISC-V payload.

    Q. Where does the SPL reader load my code?
    A. 0x08000000.

    Q. What quirks do I need to worry about to make the UART bootloader work?
    A. The binary payload must be greater than 32 bytes long.

    Q. How long did it take to get Hello World to work?
    A. 10 days.
